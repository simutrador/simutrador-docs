# SimuTrador

## Complete Trading Simulation Platform

**SimuTrador** is a comprehensive trading simulation platform combining robust historical data management with high-fidelity order execution simulation.

It consists of three integrated systems, the data manager that internally handles the download and update of candles up to 1 minute, the Simulation Server which simulates real-time order execution and market conditions and the Simulation client which provides an SDK for connecting to the server.

Together, they provide a full solution for **strategy development, backtesting, and validation**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Philosophy

Built on **privacy-respecting, realistic simulation**:

- **Keep strategy private** â€“ no code uploads
- **Realistic execution** â€“ slippage, latency, commissions
- **Use your own data** â€“ client manages access, server validates execution
- **One logic for research â†’ production**

### Data Separation Model

```
Client: Strategy logic, data access, order generation
Server: Validation, execution simulation, portfolio tracking
```
