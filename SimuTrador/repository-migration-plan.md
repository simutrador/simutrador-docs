**Result**: Modern, scalable, multi-repository architecture achieved

## Migration Overview

Successfully restructured the SimuTrador monorepo into a hybrid multi-repo architecture with three independent repositories, shared libraries, and comprehensive documentation strategy.

### Before: Monolithic Repository

```
simutrador/ (single repository)

├── documentation/    # Mixed documentation
└── .git             # Single git repository
```

### After: Multi-Repository Ecosystem

```
simutrador/ (organized project folder)
├── simutrador-core/           # ✅ Shared library (independent repo)
├── simutrador-data-manager/   # ✅ Data management system (independent repo)

## Development Workflow

### 🛠️ Working with Multiple Repositories

**VS Code Workspace** (Recommended):

```
# Open the multi-repository workspace
code simutrador.code-workspace
```

**Individual Repository Development**:

```
# Core library development
cd simutrador-core
uv sync && uv run python -c "import simutrador_core; print('✅ Core library ready')"

# Data manager development
cd simutrador-data-manager
cd backend && uv sync && uv run fastapi dev src/main.py

# Documentation editing
cd simutrador-docs
# Open with Obsidian or any markdown editor
```

### 🔄 Dependency Management

- **simutrador-core**: Independent, no internal dependencies
- **simutrador-data-manager**: Depends on `simutrador-core` package
- **simutrador-docs**: Independent documentation repository

### 🧪 Testing Strategy

Each repository maintains its own test suite:

- **simutrador-core**: Unit tests for models and utilities
- **simutrador-data-manager**: Integration tests, API tests, E2E tests (143 tests)
- **simutrador-docs**: Documentation validation and link checking

## Lessons Learned

### ✅ What Worked Well

1.  **Incremental Migration**: Starting with core library extraction provided a solid foundation
2.  **Quality Gates**: Pre-push hooks prevented quality regressions during migration
3.  **Documentation Strategy**: Cross-referenced docs improved discoverability
