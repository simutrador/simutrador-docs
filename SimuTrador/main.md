# SimuTrador - Complete Trading Simulation Platform

## Overview

**SimuTrador** is a comprehensive trading simulation platform that combines robust historical data management with high-fidelity order execution simulation. The platform consists of two integrated systems:

1.  **OHLCV Data Manager** - A sophisticated data pipeline for fetching, storing, and processing historical market data
2.  **WebSocket Simulation Engine** - A real-time trading simulator that executes orders against historical data with realistic market conditions

Together, these systems provide developers and quantitative traders with a complete solution for strategy development, backtesting, and validation.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

SimuTrador is built on the principle of **privacy-respecting realistic simulation**. Unlike traditional backtesting platforms that require you to upload your strategy code, SimuTrador allows you to:

- **Keep your strategy logic private** - Your proprietary algorithms never leave your environment
- **Test with realistic execution** - Includes slippage, latency, and commissions for accurate results
- **Use your own data** - Client manages market data access while server validates execution
- **Scale from research to production** - Same logic works for backtesting and live trading

## 🧩 Multi-Repository Structure (Mono → Multi Repo)

SimuTrador is organized as a set of focused repositories that work together in a single VS Code workspace.

Project workspace layout:

```
simutrador/ (local workspace folder)
├── simutrador-core/              # Shared Python models & utilities (Open Source - MIT)
├── simutrador-data-manager/      # OHLCV data pipeline and APIs (Open Source - MIT)
├── simutrador-docs/              # Documentation vault (Open Source - MIT)
├── simutrador-client/            # Python client SDK for the WebSocket API (Open Source - MIT)
└── simutrador-simulation-server/ # Simulation engine (Private)
```

- Simulation server (private): https://github.com/simutrador/simutrador-simulation-server

Open the multi-repo workspace in VS Code:

```
code simutrador.code-workspace
```

Notes:

- simutrador-core is versioned and consumed by other repos. During development, some repos pull it from TestPyPI until the final PyPI release.
- Each repo uses uv for dependency management, strict type checking with Pyright, Ruff for linting, and pre-push hooks for quality gates.

## 🔧 Getting Started

### 1\. Data Setup

First, configure your data sources and begin collecting historical data:

```
# Start the OHLCV Manager
curl -X POST http://localhost:8002/nightly-update/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symbols": ["AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT"]}'
```

### 2\. Authentication

Obtain your API credentials and exchange for a JWT token:

```
# Get JWT token
curl -X POST https://api.simutrador.com/auth/token \
  -H "X-API-Key: sk_live_your_api_key_here"
```

### 3\. Simulation Setup

Connect to the WebSocket API and create your first simulation:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket(
  "wss://api.simutrador.com/ws/simulate?token=your_jwt_token"
);

// Create simulation session
ws.send(
  JSON.stringify({
    type: "create_session",
    data: {
      session_id: "my_strategy_test",
      symbols: ["AAPL", "GOOGL"],
      start: "2024-01-01T14:30:00Z",
      end: "2024-01-01T21:00:00Z",
      initial_cash: "100000.00",
    },
  })
);
```

### 4\. Strategy Implementation

Implement your trading logic with full privacy:

```python
# Your strategy logic (runs locally)
def my_strategy(timestamp, market_data):
    # Your proprietary algorithm here
    if should_buy(market_data):
        return create_buy_order("AAPL", 100)
    elif should_sell(market_data):
        return create_sell_order("AAPL", 50)
    return None
```
